# NutriMeter

In this project, I developed an application that shows the calorie, carbohydrate and protein values of foods.

While the project was developed with MVVM structure, frameworks such as Room, Retrofit, Coroutine and RxJava were used.

The data is retrieved from the internet through retrofit and displayed as a list.
